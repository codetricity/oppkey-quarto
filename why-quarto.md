# Why teams like yours often choose **Quarto** over **WordPress**

Quarto offers a lightweight, reproducible, and highly secure publishing stack—especially attractive for data-heavy or developer-centric content—while WordPress remains the go-to for GUI-first editing and plug-and-play functionality. 

| Need | How **Quarto** helps | Typical **WordPress** reality |
|------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Site speed & hosting cost** | Generates plain HTML you can deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Posit Connect, or any static server in seconds | Pages are built on-demand by PHP + a database, so you need a full LAMP/LEMP stack or a managed WP host |
| **Security & maintenance** | No runtime code, databases, or plugins → essentially nothing to hack and nothing to patch | Plugin/theme ecosystem is vibrant but risky—hundreds of new vulnerabilities are disclosed each month |
| **Reproducible, data-driven content** | Embed executable R, Python, Julia, or Observable blocks; figures/tables are regenerated every render | Requires separate notebooks, screenshots, or custom plugins; code and narrative drift over time |
| **Publish once, target many formats** | The same `.qmd` sources can output HTML, PDF, Word, slides, or e-books from a single command | Core output is HTML; converting posts to print-ready PDFs or reports usually needs extra plugins/services |
| **Dev-friendly workflow** | All content lives in plain-text files—ideal for Git, pull requests, CI/CD, and automated previews; static hosting is free or cheap | GUI-centric; versioning or rolling back changes means DB exports or premium backup services |
| **Integrated scientific/technical features** | Built-in cross-refs, equations (Pandoc), callouts, diagram shortcodes, full-text search, etc., with no extra plugins | Many of these require separate plugins or custom code (each one adding maintenance overhead) |

## When Quarto really shines

- **Technical blogs, docs & dashboards** where code, data, and prose must stay in sync.  
- **Teams already using Git/GitHub** for source control and collaboration.  
- **Sites that must be rock-solid under traffic spikes** (no PHP processes to exhaust).  
- **Budgets that favor free static hosting** over managed WordPress plans.

## Situations where WordPress can still be the faster path

- **Marketing sites that change daily** and are edited by non-technical staff via WYSIWYG.  
- **Complex community or commerce features** (forums, memberships, carts) you'd rather install than build from scratch.  
- **Large plugin-driven ecosystems** (SEO suites, LMS platforms, etc.) you rely on.
